# ComposureSense - Your Personal Body Language Coach

## What is ComposureSense?

ComposureSense is like having a friendly coach who helps you improve how you present yourself. Whether you're preparing for a job interview, a presentation, or just want to appear more confident in videos, ComposureSense gives you honest feedback about your body language.

## How Does It Work?

It's super simple! You can:

1. **Take a photo** - Snap a quick picture and see how your posture looks
2. **Upload a video** - Record yourself speaking or presenting, and get detailed feedback
3. **Use live analysis** - Turn on your camera and get real-time tips as you practice

The app looks at things like:
- How you're standing or sitting (your posture)
- What your face is showing (are you smiling? do you look confident?)
- How you're using your hands
- Your overall body language

## What Do You Get?

After analyzing your photo or video, ComposureSense gives you:

- **An overall score** - A simple number showing how well you're doing
- **What you're doing great** - Your strengths to keep doing
- **What to work on** - Specific things you can improve
- **Helpful tips** - Easy suggestions to look more confident and professional

## Real-Time Practice Mode

The coolest feature is the live camera mode! Turn it on and practice your presentation or interview answers while getting instant feedback like:
- "Straighten your shoulders - they appear uneven"
- "Keep your head centered and steady"
- "Sit up straighter - improve your posture"

It's like having a personal coach watching and helping you improve on the spot!

## Who Is This For?

Anyone who wants to:
- Prepare for job interviews
- Practice presentations or speeches
- Improve their confidence on camera
- Look more professional in video calls
- Understand what their body language is saying

## Why Use ComposureSense?

Because first impressions matter! Your body language often speaks louder than your words. ComposureSense helps you understand what you're communicating non-verbally and how to improve it - without needing an expensive coach or taking special classes.

## Getting Started

Just visit the app, choose how you want to practice (photo, video, or live), and start getting feedback. It's that simple!
